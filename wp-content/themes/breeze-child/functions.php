The sales agent,Ken S.,was not only knowledgeable but also keenly attentive,taking the time to grasp my specific needs and preferences. He expertly navigated me through an array of window styles and door options,sharing comprehensive details about energy efficiency,materials,and design choices. This bespoke approach instilled a sense of confidence in my decisions,making the entire process feel personalized and focused on my satisfaction.\n\nAfter placing my order,Window World promptly informed me about the anticipated installation timeline. I genuinely appreciated the regular updates they provided,which kept me well-informed about the approximate date for installation\u2014it was reassuring to see that everything was executed right on schedule. This transparent communication allowed me to prepare my home effectively and coordinate my schedule around the installation.\n\nOn the day of the installation,the crew arrived punctually at the agreed-upon time,exuding professionalism from the moment they set foot on my property. They were fully equipped and ready to tackle the tasks at hand. I was particularly taken by their meticulous approach; they carefully dismantled the old windows and sliding door,ensuring that my home sustained no damage throughout the process.\n\nOne aspect that particularly left an impression on me was their unwavering dedication to cleanliness. After completing the installation,the crew made a concerted effort to leave my home in pristine condition. Each of my belongings was treated with the utmost care,and they took the time to clean up every scrap and dust particle,ensuring that their work left no trace behind\u2014a testament to their professionalism.\n\nIf you're considering enhancing your home with a new sliding door,basement windows,or any other window replacements,I wholeheartedly recommend Window World. Their pricing stands out as incredibly competitive compared to many other window companies,all while offering high-quality products that are backed by a transferable lifetime warranty. This warranty is a remarkable selling point,as it can be transferred to new homeowners,adding immense value if you ever decide to sell your property.\n\nMoreover,their customer service is truly exceptional; any questions or concerns I had were addressed promptly and courteously,showing their commitment to client satisfaction. Overall,my experience was thoroughly rewarding,and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Window World to anyone in need of window or door replacements. Keep up the fantastic work,Window World! I eagerly look forward to returning for my next home improvement project.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrew Kibet"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"Excellent experience from the sales team to customer service to installers.

He wasn't aggressive,understood and respected my decision making process.\n\nOnce I decided to go ahead with them,Madison from the office provided me a reasonable ETA for when windows would be ready for install. I ordered during the 2024 year-end and was told to expect installation in 2nd week of January but that she would put in a note to see if I could be slotted in early - I was pleasantly surprised on receiving a call to schedule during the first week of Jan!

This was maybe 7-8 yrs ago and the windows are still in great shape. We didn\u2019t get new sliders (for the back deck area) because at the time,the existing ones were fine. But now it was time to install new ones. Due to the lifetime warranty,as well as not having to deal with third party installers,AND the quality of their work the first time around,we had sliders with built-in blinds installed. Price was reasonable (after some negotiation),installers arrived earlier than expected (in AM time block when I was told PM time frame,but that\u2019s okay,I was home),and installed a beautiful slider in two hours time. They removed the casing of the existing sliders,the doors itself,and the blinds with rack and hauled away. They cleaned up after and showed me how to use the built-in blinds and locking features. They did a nice,neat,clean job. The next day there was a nasty rain/sleet wind storm but the sliders stood strong,no leaks,or damage to the outside (caulk was neat,smooth,threshold of door was secure,measurements were precise). The built-in blinds are beautiful and a space saver! Plus it brings so much light into the kitchen now. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the entire process,from no pressure (free) consultation to install date - it took approximately 5 weeks from order date to custom make the door to delivery/install date (during holiday season too).

Like other companies they didn't rip me off financially and compromised the quality of windows.\nI wish Rimo and his team all the best and my God Bless them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sid Soman"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"Window World is a wonderful company.

Since our old windows had many failed seals we\u2019re now enjoying the views. The best part,however,was the installation. Two crews,led by brothers George and Frank,took just a few days to replace virtually every window and door in the house. They worked very neatly and the exterior aluminum trim work/sealing is superb.

This is a small project:replace two kitchen windows. Granted there was very little to no discount for this small type of installation.\n\nDelivery Time:We were told to expect 6 to 8 weeks to custom make the windows. From the time we placed our order and re-verification of the measurement from one of their managers,our windows were ready in around 3 weeks.\n\nInstallation Time:I received a call from John of Window World of Jersey Coast to inform me my windows are ready and it can be installed as soon as the next day at 1-3 PM. I agreed and made preparations (temporarily relocated the breakfast table and chairs and removed the blinds leaving the balance). No installers came after 3 PM. Called the office and spoke to John. He apologized that someone should've called me that the installers were running behind on a current project. He offered to rescheduled that day for 5 PM. 5 PM came and went. John called and said the installers won't be able to come that day,but can come on Wednesday at 8:30 AM. I agreed.\n\n8:30 AM of Wednesday morning became 9:30 AM as they claimed to pick supplies from Home Depot.\n\nProduct:The total time took two and hald hours. This includes the removal of the old windows and installation of the new windows. It was a two man team. Thumbs up on the professional installation\n\nRecommendation:Yes,but be wary of the installation time they give you. Don't accept their first installation date and time. Set your own installation date.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Stefan G"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"From the Sales rep,Office staff to the installers,everyone was great to work with.

So before the windows got replaced certain parts of the house would be colder/warmer than others so later on that night we went from the living room into the den,dinning room,& kitchen part of our house and usually it's freezing especially when the temperature drops but it wasn't freezing it was comfortable also mom when into her bedroom which would be even colder than the rest of the house and when the wind use to blow you can watch the vertical blinds move but now her room felt like the rest of the house comfortable and warm\n\nNow to wrap this up,Window World has made this experience easy for us from start to finish,the whole cost didn't breaking the bank to get done,they replaced windows all the windows in 1 day they were,also they were all professional and job well done,now our house is more energy efficient because we are not using the space heaters I don'thave to turn on the oven every morning to make the house warm so we are SOOOO SATISFIED with our decision to go with Window World\nAlso I can't wait for spring time so I can open all the windows,LOL\n\nThanks Window World,have a blessed day,from the Waters","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Pasqual Russomanno Jr"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"It took only a month between the order and the installation,the team came on time,was extremely professional and cleaned up everything after they finished.

When I scheduled the appointment I explained that it was for my elderly mother's home,but that I would be at the appointment,and I gave them my contact number. The salesman showed up an hour and a half before the scheduled appointment,which meant that my mother was there alone. The salesman left three prices for three different types of windows,but did not even bring in a catalog to show my mother what they looked like. Nor did he bring in a sample window as is the custom,to show her the quality of the materials... the \" estimate\" he left just had 3 prices written on it. It did not indicate if that included the labor,tax,Etc... would he have tried to get away with that if I had been there? Very disappointed!\nSalesman later called me to explain why he did what he did. He said he didn't want to\"bother\" my mother by showing her catalogs and the sample window. He said he had intended to do that when he came back and had an appointment with both of us. Well he didn't show up for the scheduled appointment,so when was he planning to meet with me?? Obvious Baloney!\nI previously had used windowworld in my own home,and the service and windows were fine. I had no complaints. That is why I called them again for my mother's home. But I feel I was disrespected by the salesman because he didn't come to the scheduled appointment... And I feel he disrespected my mother by not bothering to show her catalogs and/or a samples of what he wanted her to purchase from him. I feel that if she was not elderly,he would have handled the appointment differently. The salesman can give me all his excuses in the world,but instead I would rather he just say he's sorry,and then decide to conduct his future appointments in a manner that is respectful to his customer,no matter what their age,or how big or small the prospective contract estimate.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"0"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cindy Defino"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"George and his crew were very professional and their craftsmanship was a compliment to their trade .
